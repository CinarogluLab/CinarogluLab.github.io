- title: "Evaluating the performance of water models with host–guest force fields in binding enthalpy calculations for cucurbit [7] uril–guest systems"
  image: pub3.jpeg
  description: We present absolute enthalpy calculations using the multibox approach on a set of 25 cucurbit[7]uril–guest pairs. Eight water models were considered (TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P-Ew, SPC, SPC/E, OPC, TIP5P, Bind3P), along with five force fields commonly used in the literature (GAFFv1, GAFFv2, CGenFF, Parsley, and SwissParam).

- title: "Comprehensive evaluation of the MM-GBSA method on bromodomain-inhibitor sets"
  image: pub4.jpeg
  description: This study reports an extensive testing of different MM-GBSA scoring schemes on two bromodomain (BRD) datasets. The first set is composed of 24 BRPF1 complexes, and the second one is a nonredundant set constructed from the PDBbind and composed of 28 diverse BRD complexes. A variety of MM-GBSA schemes were analyzed to evaluate the performance of four protocols with different numbers of minimization and MD steps, 10 different force fields and three different water models.

  image: pub5.jpeg
  description: This study reports comparative assessment of seven docking programs (AutoDock4, AutoDock4Zn, AutoDock Vina, Quick Vina 2, LeDock, PLANTS, and UCSF DOCK6) on a diverse metalloprotein set which was compiled for this study. The refined set of the PDBbind (2017) was screened to gather 710 complexes with metal ion(s) closely located to the ligands (<4 Å).
