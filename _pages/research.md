## Research in Molecular Modeling & Drug Discovery

**Bio-molecular Dynamics**
The internal motions of bio-molecules are crucial for their biological function. Sophisticated molecular simulations are used to create detailed models of these movements, spanning timeframes from picoseconds to milliseconds. By analyzing these models, researchers gain insights into how bio-molecular dynamics are affected by external factors, such as the presence of ligands or mutations. This understanding is key to unraveling the complex mechanisms of structural dynamics, a fundamental process in cellular signaling and regulation.
