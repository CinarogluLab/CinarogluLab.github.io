#### **Biomolecular Dynamics**

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">

<div style="flex: 3; text-align: justify; margin-right: 20px;">
The internal motions of biomolecules are crucial for their biological function. Sophisticated molecular simulations are used to create detailed models of these movements, spanning timeframes from picoseconds to milliseconds. By analyzing these models, researchers gain insights into how external factors, such as the presence of ligands or mutations, affect biomolecular dynamics. This understanding is key to unravelling the complex mechanisms of structural dynamics, a fundamental process in cellular signalling and regulation.

CADD is a cornerstone of modern pharmaceutical research. It leverages computational techniques to expedite and optimize the identification and development of new therapeutic agents. By utilizing a combination of molecular modelling, simulations, and data analysis, CADD offers a powerful approach to tackle complex challenges in drug design, from target identification and validation to lead optimization and virtual screening. This interdisciplinary field holds immense promise in revolutionizing drug discovery pipelines and accelerating the delivery of novel treatments for various diseases. This integration of computational power into drug discovery reduces the need for costly physical experiments and enhances the precision and efficiency of developing new therapeutics.

#### **Host-Guest Chemistry**

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">

<div style="flex: 3; text-align: justify; margin-right: 20px;">

Host-guest systems emerge as pivotal models in our quest for precision in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. They mirror the complexities of larger protein-ligand systems but demand far less computational power. Their binding affinities align closely with those observed in protein-ligand interactions, establishing them as ideal subjects for detailed molecular recognition studies.

Our research group leverages host-guest systems' simplicity and efficiency to enhance molecular dynamics simulations' reliability. Through these models, we aim to advance our understanding and refine our application of force fields, ultimately improving the accuracy of our simulations across more demanding biological systems. This foundational work is crucial for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in computational molecular modelling.

Our lab actively contributes to the VirtualFlow project, led by Dr. Christoph Gorgulla. VirtualFlow is a free, open-source initiative to facilitate widespread use and dynamic development within the scientific community. It encourages researchers to join the project and contribute to enhancing existing features and expanding its functionality. For more information and resources, please visit the official VirtualFlow homepage at <https://www.virtual-flow.org>.

A key component of VirtualFlow is the VirtualFlow virtual screen (VFVS), a powerful tool designed to explore vast regions of chemical space in search of promising small-molecule binders. VFVS leverages high-performance computing resources, which continue to grow in availability and power, and innovative virtual screening databases like the Chemical Universe Databases, which house billions to trillions of compounds yet to be fully explored.
